Logo Analog is a clean analog watch face with an always active second hand, step count and battery
graphs and a move indicator. 

## Purpose & Goal
Logo Analog is designed to be a jumping point for anyone wanting to build an analog watch face,
especially one featuring a company, team, group logo or some other image (logo not included).

## License
This watch face is licensed under the "MIT License", which essentially means that while Douglas
Robertson retains the copyright to the original code, you are free to do whatever you'd like with
this code (or any derivative of it). See the LICENSE.txt file for further details.

## Getting Started
Download or clone the repo and add the project to your Eclipse workspace. Read, run, learn and enjoy!

## Repo Details
It is assumed that you are using the most current (stable/non-beta) SDK and all attempts are made
to ensure that the code on the 'master' branch will run on the most current SDK. If, in the future,
changes are made to the SDK that would prevent the watch face from being compiled or support for
one or more devices needs to be dropped, the code will be moved to a separate branch named for that
particular SDK version and/or device.
